\subsection{Detailed Description}
Plots a histogram of the spatial frequency of pixel standard deviations. 

The histogram displays the spacial frequency of the standard deviations calculated for the standard deviation frame. Each bar represents a range of sigma (in D\+N) that the individual pixel sigmas are binned within. These data are plotted with a logarithmic x-\/axis. Scrolling on the mouse wheel will zoom in and out. The standard viewing scale omits dead pixel bars, but these can be viewed by zooming out. \begin{DoxyAuthor}{Author}
