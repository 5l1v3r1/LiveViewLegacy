Live View is a Qt frontend G\+U\+I for cuda\+\_\+take, it displays focal plane data and basic analysis (such as the std. dev, dark subtraction, F\+F\+T, Spectral Profile, and Video Savant-\/like playback). Plots are implemented using the Q\+Custom\+Plot (\href{http://www.qcustomplot.com}{\tt http\+://www.\+qcustomplot.\+com}) library, which generates live color maps, bar graphs, and line graphs within the Qt C++ environment. 

Live View is designed to be sufficiently modular that it will plot any data with known geometry, up to a maximum word size of 16 bits. To implement new hardware or modify existing parameters, changes must be made to the backend cuda\+\_\+take software.
