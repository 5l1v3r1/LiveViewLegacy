\subsection{Detailed Description}
Widget which plots live color maps of image data. 

The \hyperlink{classframeview__widget}{frameview\+\_\+widget} is the first view which is displayed on opening Live View. There are three main image types which are categorized as frameviews. The \char`\"{}\+Live View\char`\"{} is considered a B\+A\+S\+E image. This is the image\+\_\+data\+\_\+ptr array of the frame\+\_\+c data structure. The D\+S\+F image type is contains dark subtracted data if a mask has been collected. Otherwise it displays zero. Both B\+A\+S\+E and D\+S\+F image types accept mouse events as a method for selecting the crosshair. The S\+T\+D\+\_\+\+D\+E\+V image type displays the standard deviation calculation from cuda\+\_\+take. 

When constructing a copy of this widget, you must select one of the above three members of the image\+\_\+t enum.
