\subsection{Detailed Description}
Communicates with the backend and connects public information between widgets. 

The fram\+Worker class contains backend and analysis information that must be shared between classes in the G\+U\+I. Structurally, \hyperlink{classframeWorker}{frame\+Worker} is a worker object tied to a Q\+Thread started in main. The main event loop in this object may therefore be considered the function handle\+New\+Frame() which periodically grabs a frame from the backend and checks for asynchronous signals from the filters about the status of the data processing. A frame may still be displayed even if analysis functions associated with it time out for the loop. In general, the \hyperlink{classframeWorker}{frame\+Worker} is the only object with a copy of the take\+\_\+object and should exclusively handle communication with cuda\+\_\+take.
