\subsection{Detailed Description}
Widget which contains the G\+U\+I elements common to several or all plotting widgets. 

The \hyperlink{classControlsBox}{Controls\+Box} is a wrapper G\+U\+I class which contains the (mostly) static controls between widgets. After establishing the buttons in the constructor, the class will call the function tab\+\_\+slot\+\_\+changed(int index) to establish widget-\/specific controls and settings. For instance, all profile widgets and F\+F\+Ts make use of the Lines To Average slider rather than the disabled Std Dev N slider. As Qt does not support a pure virtual interface for widgets, each widget must make a connection to its own version of update\+Ceiling(int c), update\+Floor(int f), and any other widget specfic action within its case in tab\+\_\+slot\+\_\+changed(int index). The beginning of this function specifies the behavior for when tabs are exited -\/ all connections made must be disconnected.
