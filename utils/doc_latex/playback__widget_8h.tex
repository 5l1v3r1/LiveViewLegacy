\subsection{Detailed Description}
Enables the playback of image data in a video player environment. 

The Playback Widget offers self-\/contained playback of data. It is assumed that the data being viewed has the same geometry as the currently loaded camera hardware. Playback is handled using V\+C\+R-\/like controls. Users may drag and drop data onto the viewing window to load a file, or use the folder icon on the left side of the window. 

The widget is split into two main classes\+: the \hyperlink{classbuffer__handler}{buffer\+\_\+handler} and the \hyperlink{classplayback__widget}{playback\+\_\+widget}. The buffer class is a worker type class which runs in a parallel thread to the main G\+U\+I. It controls the file read operations for the Just-\/\+In-\/\+Time (J\+I\+T) buffer which handles frame data for the playback. Whenever a new frame needs to be loaded, it is read from the file several microseconds before being plotted. A mutex handles serialization of the image data between the two threads. In the playback widget, all the G\+U\+I components, frame movement, and plotting are handled. \begin{DoxyAuthor}{Author}
