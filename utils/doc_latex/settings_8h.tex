\subsection{Detailed Description}
Defines frame rate rendering constants for Live View. 

The settings contain three main constants -\/ the frameskip factor, the target framerate and the frame draw period. The backend generates frames at a significantly faster rate than Q\+Custom\+Plot can handle (100fps for 6604-\/\+A, and 118fps for 6604\+B). Therefore we should only draw every frame modulo 10 to improve graphical performance. The target framerate sets the ideal fps for the frontend display, particularly for the \hyperlink{classframeview__widget}{frameview\+\_\+widget}.
